# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here against the version that shipped them.
The version constant lives in `src/tychoc.c` (`TYCHO_VERSION`, printed by
`tychoc --version`); bump both together. Per-release publishing notes stay in
`RELEASE_NOTES.md`; this file is the accumulating record.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-05

The 1.0 promotion. The language surface and the spec are now the stability
contract (see the README's status banner); what follows is the last chain of
work that landed ahead of it.

- **Batteries-included corelib (phase 1).** Six new packages, each with a test
  + golden + guide entry: `core:testing` (assert/eq/report unit-test state),
  `core:toml` (recursive table/array parser, fail-closed), `core:log`
  (leveled logging, threaded state), `core:sqlite` (direct FFI over
  libsqlite3 — the dbquery pattern), `core:utf8` (validation and codepoint
  iteration, strict rejection of overlong/surrogate/truncated sequences), and
  `core:zip` (reader/writer over a new raw-deflate path in `core:compress`,
  CRC-32 in-package). `core:compress` gained raw deflate/inflate.
- **Vendored dependencies (phase 2).** The importer-relative import story
  documented as the vendoring convention (`vendor/` layout, flat-vendor
  shape); `tycho-fetch <url> <name>` downloads and unpacks a package tarball
  into `vendor/` with sha256 verification (dogfooding core:http + core:sha256
  + core:io); `core:http` gained `body_bytes(r)` — the string `body()`
  truncated at NULs, so binary downloads were impossible.
- **Debugger (phase 3).** `tycho debug <file.ty>` / `tools/tycho-debug/` — a
  gdb adapter: compiles with `-g`, drives a scripted gdb session over pipes
  (breakpoints by source line, step/next, locals under their Tycho names,
  Ctrl-C interrupts a running inferior). Gated by `make debug-check`.
- **1.0 promotion (this phase).** `tychoc --version` and the version constant;
  the README's status banner flips from research prototype to the 1.0
  contract (stable: the language surface and the spec; not stable:
  performance tuning and benches); a security review of the FFI shims
  (string/bytes ownership, the core:os shell-out paths, the TLS wrapper)
  with findings recorded in `SECURITY.md`; and the corelib 1.0 API-freeze
  decision with its deprecation path, recorded in `docs/guides/corelib.md`.

## [0.1.0] — earlier

The pre-1.0 research-prototype release. See `RELEASE_NOTES.md` at the
`v0.1.0` tag for what it contained; it carried no stability guarantees.
